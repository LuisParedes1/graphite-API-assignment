# Data Analysis

Inside of the [Jupyter Notebook](./DataAnalysis.ipynb) we do an inital data analysis to see what we are working with and check for any NaN values.

We finish by concatenating all three datasets into a single one which we'll use for the project.

To run the notebook:

- conda activate (this will activate the base environment)
- jupyter-notebook DataAnalysis.ipynb
- Install pandas with `!pip install pandas`
- Run the cells (cntl+enter)

# Execute the program

# Open in Swagger
